# Spark air traffic analyzer 2021

COVID-19 pandemic affected almost all aspects of our everyday life
with a tourism and, ergo, passenger airlines being ones of the
highly impacted businesses. Itâ€™s known that most of the airlines
showed large revenue losses and some of them even went
bankrup.

Finding out and depicting which route/airline has been affected
the most/the least, which airport had the most flight number
reduction and so on seems like a proper data engineering task.

This project transforms and visualise global air traffic data for both historical and real-time data sources.

## The main parts of project
 - Analyzing historical air traffic data as a one-time job
 - Gaining real-time air traffic data in streaming manner
 - Depicting different metrics of how COVID-19 pandemic affected air traffic in the last year
